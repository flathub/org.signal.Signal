# Signal Desktop

This repo hosts the flatpak version of [Signal-Desktop](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop)

Signal-Desktop is a Private Messenger that links with your installed Android/iOS version of Signal.

Note that this is an **unofficial** redistribution.

## Installing

```bash
flatpak install flathub org.signal.Signal
```

## Options
You can set the following environment variables:

* `SIGNAL_USE_TRAY_ICON=1`: Enables the tray icon
* `SIGNAL_START_IN_TRAY=1`: Starts in tray
* `SIGNAL_USE_WAYLAND=1`: Enables Wayland support
* `SIGNAL_DISABLE_GPU=1`: Disables GPU acceleration
* `SIGNAL_DISABLE_GPU_SANDBOX=1`: Disables GPU sandbox

## Wayland
The integration between Chromium, Electron, and Wayland seems broken.
Adding an additional layer of complexity like Flatpak can't help.
For now, using this repo with wayland should be regarded as experimental.

Wayland support can be enabled with `SIGNAL_USE_WAYLAND=1` in [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal).

Wayland support can also be enabled on the command line:

```bash
flatpak override --user --env=SIGNAL_USE_WAYLAND=1 org.signal.Signal
```

GPU acceleration may be need to be disabled:

```bash
flatpak override --user --env=SIGNAL_DISABLE_GPU=1 org.signal.Signal
```

Additionally, Nvidia devices may need the GPU sandbox disabled:

```bash
flatpak override --user --env=SIGNAL_DISABLE_GPU_SANDBOX=1 org.signal.Signal
```

## Issue reporting

**Please only report issues in this repo that are specific to the flatpak version.**

Issues that can be replicated in a stable release should be reported in the [upstream repo](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Desktop).
Make sure, that the reported issue is **not** flatpak-related.
